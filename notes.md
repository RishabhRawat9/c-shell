1. Creating the child process and executing the command in the child
2. Providing a history feature
3. Adding support of input and output redirection
4. Allowing the parent and child processes to communicate via a pipe

ok so to implememt the history feature what do i need to do.

1. i need to check the input for when the user presses the up arrow key
2. if he does press it then i need to search the recently executed commands and display that
   on the console.
3. should i store in a text file or an array
